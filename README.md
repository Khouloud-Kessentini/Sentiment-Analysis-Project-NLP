# Sentiment-Analysis-Project-NLP

The main steps include:

1.   Data pre-processing

  *   Data loading and columns selection
  *   Convert reviews to lowercase and remove emojis, numbers and punctuation
  *   Remove stop words ("and", "in", "at", etc)

2.   One-Hot encoding of reviews (conversion of text reviews to boolean vectors)
3.   Splitting data into test and evaluation (cross-validation 80% - 20%)
4.   Neural network implementation
  * Architecture:
      *  Input layer size  = number of variables (columns) in the One-Hot matrix
      *  Hidden layer 1 size = 64
      *  Hidden layer 2 size = 128
      *  Output layer size = 2 (number of classes, or potential reviews; either 0 or 1)
5.   Adding dropout to prevent overfitting
6.   Testing model accuracy
